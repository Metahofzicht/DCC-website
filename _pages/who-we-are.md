Our purpose is to enable TU Delft researchers to do even more efficient, effective and exciting research through improved digital competence.

The Digital Competence Centre (DCC) is set up to coordinate the support for data and software required for 21st-century research within TU Delft.
It is a collaboration between the University Library and the central IT department and alligns the work of the Data Managers, Research Software Engineers, Data Stewards and Faculty IT Managers (FIMs).
