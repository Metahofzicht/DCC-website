If you have a support question for a digital aspect of your research, please [send us an email](mailto:dcc@tudelft.nl).

For smaller requests for support, which are estimated to take less than 30 hours, simply [email us](mailto:dcc@tudelft.nl).

If you need more support, you can request that a Data Manager or Research Software Engineer (RSE) joins your group for up to two days per week, for a period of up to 6 months.
