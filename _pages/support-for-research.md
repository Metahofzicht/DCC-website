If you have a support question for a digital aspect of your research, please [send us an email](mailto:support4research@tudelft.nl).

If you need more support, you can request that a Data Manager or Research Software Engineer (RSE) joins your group for two days per week, for a period of between 2 and 6 months. 
If at all possible, the DCC team member will be physically present in your group for at least one day per week. 
The second day per week, the DCC team member will work closely with other DCC team members, so that you also benefit from their shared knowledge and skill sets.
