# Introduction/Purpose 

The DCC team supports researchers in improving software development and data management practices. Team members will temporarily join research groups to work together on setting up or improving working practises, workflows and software development. 

A suitable assignment combines a research goal with a data and/or software engineering hurdle to be overcome. 

# What can be applied for? 

You can request that a DCC team member joins your group for two days per week, for a period of between 2 and 6 months. 

If at all possible, the DCC team member will be physically present in your group for at least one day per week. You will be expected to have someone from you group available to work together with the DCC team member and to supply a suitable workspace for them, including a desk, adjustable office chair and monitor. 

The second day per week, the DCC team member will work closely with other DCC team members, so that you also benefit from their shared knowledge and skill sets. 

# Who may apply? 

You must have an academic contract at the TU Delft for at least the duration of the assignment. 

# When to apply 

You can apply whenever you wish. Dedicated calls for applications will be organised every 6 months (rolling applications will be accepted, depending on capacity).
